pip3 list  in command prompt
what if we want diffrent versions of request for that we need to create a isolated virtual enviroment for each application and 
install these dependancies into that virtual isolated enviroment where we have specific packages and different interpreter

python3  -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate.bat  for windows
 
pip3 install requests==2.9.*


Pipenv --venv - to check virtual enviroment we should be in that folder
C:\Users\nakul\OneDrive\Documents\pythonprogrammes\pythonresume\parentpackage\Pythonpackageindex>
rm -rf (path to virtual enviroment)

pipenv graph -> to know dependancies in our project

pip3 uninstall requests - request packages will be unistall u can check in your pip file that section will be deleted.

pipenv update --outdated
