Pipenv is a tool that combine virtual enviroments into a single tool chain, so we dont have to use pip or virtual enviroment
seprate.if you're familiar with npm ,or node package manager, pipenv is the equivalent in the python world
so its a dependancy manager for python projects now you might 
pip3 install pipenv
pipenv install requests
pipfile and piffle.lock created
pipenv --venv
C:\Users\nakul\.virtualenvs\Pythonpackageindex-aCtR18SB
to activate the virtual enviromentpipenv shell
pipenv shell
if you simply want to deactivate type exit
now we are out of virtual enviroment

Pip uninstall requests

what happen when we run this programme using code runner extension.
